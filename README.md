# Emotion_awareness
Its a system that uses a webcam to capture a person's facial expression, analyze their emotions, and respond with appropriate visual or textual feedback : a smart mirror that can "perceive" how you're feeling.
This project simulates the human perceptual process:

* Visual sensing (camera as the eye)
* Interpretation (emotion recognition via machine learning)
* Emotional response (feedback on screen)
* Suggest activities (play music)

How it can help:

* it can help in mental health monitoring
* Can be used in smart mirrors, educational robots, or autistic care assistants
* Encourages self-awareness in users by reflecting emotional state
* Useful for health, education, caregiving, and wellness tech
